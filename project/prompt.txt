I need you to write a code for model in General Algebraic Modeling language (.gms file) for a game which goal is to maximize "line" (game currency) generation. I need to be able to build it in GAMS Studio program.

Rules of the game:
- Grid 5x5 (make it a variable)
- You can't go over instability
- Starting 100 instability capacity, total of 10% of instability capacity generation is allowed (ONLY otherwise the grid is invalid)
- Maximize line generation by placing specific elements:
    - Hourglass: 
        - Increases line generation by 5
        - Increases instability generation and line generation by 40% for adjacent elements (only north,south,west,east)
        - Increases instability generation by 3

    - Diamond:
        - Reduces instability generation of adjacent elements by 2
    - Square:
        - Increases instability capacity by 10
    - Triangle:
        - Increases line generation for adjacent elements by 100% (cannot boost other triangles)
        - Increases instability generation for adjacent elements by 67%

The result of solving the model should provide most efficient placement of elements across the grid with the instability generation within the allowed capacity.
